# GoBot

This bot is based on the work of mxrch (https://github.com/mxrch/HackTheBot/). 
I rewrited the bot in Go. Some features are missing and I'm still working on it. Some features are not implemented on purpose.

Commands :

    Synchronize your Hack The Box account with the Discord server
    Retrieve information about a box 
    Retrieve information about a Hack The Box member
    Search for items among Ippsec videos
    Retrieve information on the last box released
    View the leaderboard of Discord server members
    List active boxes
    Manage channel when a new box is comming

In the shoutbox, display :

    The pwn user / root of the boxes and challenges.
    If a member gets a VIP pass
    How long before the new box arrives
    When the box arrived
    The pwn flags of the prolabs

Other :

    Unlike Hack The Box's Discord server bot, this bot automatically updates your rank.
    It automatically manage channel when a new box is out.
